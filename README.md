# Joyride

## Description

A simple Chrome extension that maps button presses from the Gamepad API to
KeyboardEvents. This scratches a personal itch of allowing connecting a Nintendo
Switch Joy-Con to a Pixelbook and use it to control a presentation that expects
the left and right arrow keys.

This is very early, don't expect much functionality or reliability.

## Developer installation

* Enable `Developer Mode` under `chrome://extensions`
* Choose "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" and select the directory containing this
  project
* The button should appear in your top bar. Click to run for the current tab
